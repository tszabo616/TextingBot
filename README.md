# Texting-Bot

This program is a messaging application that allows the user to have a text chat with a bot. The model for the bot is a recurrent neural network (RNN), which was trained on about 8,100 lines (5 years worth) of text messaging data with my friend, Apu. The text reponse from the bot results from text prediction based on the newly sent message plus the rest of the text conversation.
